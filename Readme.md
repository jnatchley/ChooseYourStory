 # Jessica Atchley's C# Project: "Choose Your Story"
<br>
 This project is meant to be a choose your own adventure story. This project will lead you through a series of questions, and depending on how you answer, the program will direct you down the path you've chosen. This project was made with C# and created by using various features learned through the Treehouse videos.
<br>
<br>

## Features that are included in this project according to the "3 required features" project requirements:
<br>


The following features are currently not finalized and may change, this is just a list of features I am thinking about using


1. Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

--> 

2. Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent

--> 

3. Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

--> 

4. Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application

--> Pulled a quote from quote.txt for one of the paths chosen and displayed it

5. Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)

--> 

6. Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data

-->

-Any special instructions required for the reviewer to run the project
3. At least 3 items on the Features List and implemented them in project
4. Creation of at least 1 class, as well as an object of that class populated with data that is used in the project.
5. Created and called at least 3 functions or methods, with at least one return value
